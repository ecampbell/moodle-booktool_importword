# How to install the Word template moodleBookStartup.dotm

This Word template contains VBA macro code and adds a new "Styles" Ribbon menu to the Word interface.
The best place to install it is as a global template in your Word Startup folder. This is generally 
set by default to somewhere like _C:\Users\**{yourname}**\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP_

Note that it runs in Microsoft Word on Windows PCs only. It does not run on the web version of Word,
or on the Apple Mac.

Here are the steps to install the template in the correct location.
1. Start Microsoft Word on your Windows PC.

2. Choose _File > Options_ to open the Word Options dialog box,
   select the Advanced panel on the left, and scroll down to the **General** section.
   
3. Click the "File Locations..." button to open the "File Locations" dialog box.

4. Select the "Startup" file type and click the "Modify" button to open the folder selection dialog box.
   The complete path is displayed in the Path field at the top of the box. 

5. Click on the white space area at the end of the path field to select the complete path,
   and copy it by pressing "\<Ctrl>+C".

6. The path is all you need, so just exit Word now.

7. Start Windows "File Explorer" (press the "\<Windows>+E" key combination).

8. Click the path field, paste in the path ("\<Ctrl>+V"), and press <Return>.

9. Start another "File Explorer" window, go to the location where you downloaded the template to,
   and drag and drop the file to the startup folder.
   
10. Start Word again, and the "Styles" menu should now appear to the right of the "Help" menu.
